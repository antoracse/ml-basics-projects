## 🧠 Project Overview  
This project is a **machine learning classification task** that predicts the type of **Iris flower** based on four key features:  
- Sepal length  
- Sepal width  
- Petal length  
- Petal width  

The project compares multiple models to determine which algorithm performs best for this dataset.

## 🧩 Dataset Description  
The **Iris dataset** is one of the most popular datasets in machine learning, containing 150 samples from three species of Iris:  
- *Setosa*  
- *Versicolor*  
- *Virginica*  

Each sample has four numerical features and one categorical target variable.
