# 🧠 Machine Learning Basic Projects

This repository contains my early machine learning projects completed during my learning phase.  
They are now uploaded to GitHub for proper documentation and portfolio presentation.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 🪷 Iris Flower Classification
A supervised learning project predicting iris flower species using Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and Naive Bayes classifiers.

### 🛳 Titanic Survival Prediction
A classification model predicting passenger survival using logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.

## 🕒 Project Timeline
These projects were originally completed earlier during my ML practice sessions.  
They are uploaded in **October 2025** for documentation and presentation to my professor.
